# libVIODES - visual representation of libFAUDES objects as Qt Widgets


## Design Objectives


libFAUDES is readily extendible by deriving new classes for specialized
synthesis and analysis algorithms. The luabindings plug-in allows easy
integration of such extension in the scripting environment luafaudes.
We need a similar approach for libFAUDES based GUI applications. libVIODES
targets to fill the gap.

* using the libFAUDES type registry as basis
* having a general model/view approach for faudes::Type
* derive classes in parallel to faudes::Type derivates
* organise the generator widget such that is can pick up
  new attributes
* make attribute widgets really easy to create


## Organisation

VioCore: 

* base class for configuration classes (VioStyle)
* base classes for faudes::Type widgets (VioModel, VioWidget)
* helper for editing faudes symbols 
* base class for faudes::Attribute* widgets (VioAttributeModel, VioAttributeWidget)
* Qt style plugin for extensions

VioStyle:

* one static instance to configure visual and libFAUDES related defaults, eg
colors, fonts and the dot executable path
* classes derived from VioStyle to configure representations of particular faudes objects.
* all attributes are read initially from a single XML file

## Qt-Style Models vs faudes::Type

Each faudes object derived from faudes::Type is identified by its name from the faudes type registry for short fType. An fType is wrapped in a Qt-style model to hold additional
data for visual representation, eg orders of lists or positions of nodes in a graph. 
The base class for this purpose is VioModel. To allow for a single derivate of VioModel 
to represent closely related fTypes, vio models are configured by a VioStyle. The latter 
specifies the fType which the model shall represent, either read from the configuration 
file or set programmatically. Eacht derivate of VioModel and each configuration thereof 
is registered with its fType by the VioTypeRegistry.

Example given, there may be various semantics attached to the faudes flag attribute 
faudes::AttributeFlags. Each interpretation is to be registered by a distinct fType in 
the faudes type registry, eg AttributeStateFlags, AttibuteEventFlags etc. The VioAttributeStyle 
is derived from VioStyle to hold bit positions and property names. Per fType, one instance
of VioAttributeStyle is required to configure VioAttributeModel objects to represent
the respective fType.

To actually show a graphical representation, each VioModel class requiers a corresponding
VioView. The view passes on user changes via callbacks on the model. The model signals
changes via a signal/slot mechanism to the view(s). There is also a VioWidget, that
holds its own internal model and view. The VioViews learn about the model configuration
to adapt their representation, ie have proper names of checkboxes.

## Qt-Style Plug-Ins

To extend libVIODES to display a specific fType, you need to derive corresponding
VioStyle, VioModel, VioView and VioWidget classes. Via the Qt plugin mechanism, 
you can register your extensons with the VioTypeResistry. There are
demo plugins for timed generators and colord markings.


##
Plug-In/VioGen:

* plain generator representation (VioGeneratorModel, VioGeneratorWidget)
* specific generator representation (VioGeneratorList*, VioGeneratorGraph*)
* specialised Qt models/views (Lio*, Gio*)

The code of this pluglin is taken from an previous project for graph
representation (libVIOGen). There are some glitches from the merge, so don,t consider this plugin as a template to design your plugin.


## Tutorial

The base usaage of libVIODES is demonstrated by the simple Qt application "vioedit" that loads VioModels
from file and displays the corresponding VioView. It is meant as a basis
for testing ant debugging.


## Build System

To compile libVIODES, you will need Qt series 4 with minimum version 4.4.2. For Linux, you will need to install the Qt developper packages. For Mac OS X and Windows there exsist installer for Qt 4.8.5. For Windows, make sure that you choose the same compiler for Qt as you use for libFAUDES. Also make sure that the Qt toolset is within the PATH environment variable. 

You will also need a configured and compiled copy of libFAUDES. This
is expected to be located in `./libVIODES/libFAUDES_for_viodes`. For POSIX systems, we provide a skript `copyfaudes.sh` that performs this step:

    ./libVIOEDS> . ./copyfaudes.sh

The script expects a plain libFAUDES next to `./libVIODES`, copies the sources to `./libVIODES/libFAUDES_for_viodes`, sets configuration options and compiles libFAUDES using the libFAUDES `makefile`. The script is meant as a documentation on which configuration options are recommended, please inspect carefully before execution.  

Once you are set, 
compiling libVIODES is controlled by the Qt project `./libviodes/viodes.pro`. 
To compile use

    ./libVIODES> qmake viodes.pro
    ./libVIODES> make


## Authors/Copyright/License

The initial version of libVIODES was developped in the context of Ruediger Berndt's
masters project back in 2009. This version addresses the mainly type system and the plug-inmechansim.
Actual graphical representation was merged from Thomas Moor's predecessor project VIOGen, with quite some effort for the various plug-ins. Principle authors are Thomas Moor and Ruediger Berdt, distribution is by terms of the LGPL 3.
